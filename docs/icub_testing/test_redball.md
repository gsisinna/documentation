- First ensure that the dimensions of the ball are correctly inserted in the file `config.ini` (usually 31mm or 36mm depending on the ball). Depending on the ball you are using, you will need to create a specific file by using a MATLAB script (come si fa?)
- Manually calibrate the reaching and grasping by modifying the offset along the 3 axes
- Now you will need to launch and prepare the robot. Go back to the tab 1/iCubStartUp and run only the 2 iKinCartesian (for arms) and iKinGazeCtrl

- Run both wholeBodyDynamics and gravityCompensator modules

- Go back to the RedBallDemo tab. Run both `pf3dTracker` and `yarpview` modules. Now you should modify the camera parameters in order to obtain a neutral background without glowing effects and also increase the saturation until the robot recognizes the red ball.

You should see the yellow circle in the video turning green when showing the ball to the robot.
- At this point you can run the demo. Move the ball around, the robot should follow it with his eyes and reach it with his arms, eventually grasping it.
